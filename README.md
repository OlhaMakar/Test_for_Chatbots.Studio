# Test_for_Chatbots.Studio
ATTENTION!
This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

That is my solution to the test task for Chatbots.Studio
That is my first experience in creating a telegram chatbot using JavaScripts code blocks and Node-Red. 
TMDBRatebot (t.me/TMDBRatebot) - help find most rated movies from TMDb and output the TOP-3. 
After that, you can see a detailed description of each of these movies with posters by clicking on the desired button.
